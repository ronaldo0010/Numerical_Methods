# Numerical Methods

## Assignment 01
Explore the limitations of numerical analysis i.e rounding and cancellation error. 


## Assignment 02
Explore different numerical root finding methods for f(x) = 0 problems. Such as bisection, Regula-Falsi, Fixed-Point Iteration, Newton-Raphson, Halley's method, Secant, Invers Quadratic Interpolation, Steffesnsen and scipy.fsolve. Additionally tis assignment includes using numpy.linalg to perform Newton's Method for systems (P6).

## Assignment 03
